# Cucumber Protractor ES6 Template

This is a simple template of how to start a Cucumber JS/Protractor project using ES6 and Babel.

Simply fork/clone the project and run the `npm install` command from the terminal.

There are 3 npm commands that come with this project:

`npm run update-webdriver`
Needs to be run after you install the npm modules. It gets your webdriver-manager up to date.

`npm run start-webdriver`
Needs to be run in a separate terminal window from everything else. It continues running while your tests run. I'm sure you can make a combined script that starts it up and shuts it down with your tests, but I just let mine run.

`npm test`
Runs the Cucumber JS/Protractor tests.
